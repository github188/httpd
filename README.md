# httpd
this is a muti-function http server

It can already accept a large number of request,but it was unfinished yet.

Some ideas or bug was marked in 'doc',you can check it.
You must use 'make' at first,then run the server 'HTTPserver'

Some configs like IP:PORT are in /include/conf.h,it will move to 'httpsvr.conf' in the future.
